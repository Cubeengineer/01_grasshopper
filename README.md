 
Summary:  Using topology optimization technology in the design of compressed structures, the structure type can be selected under reasonable conditions based on the structural stress, and the randomness of parameter input can be used to create new compressed structure types. The two-way progressive optimization method (BESO method) is an important development direction of topology optimization technology. This group will study the topology optimization problem of pressure structures using the two-way progressive structural optimization method.

07————Summary and Outlook
Through the observation, research and practical application of digital technology, the gap between reality and reality is bridged. Introducing a large number of digital technology into the real world, creating virtual digital furniture that is "different from birth, co-created by man and machine".
However, there are still shortcomings:
1. Through the statistics of larger data, more types of products should be generated to reduce accidents and explore whether there are regularities;
2. Collect user feedback in a timely manner, rectify old content based on feedback, and develop new features.
